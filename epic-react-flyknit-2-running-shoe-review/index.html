<center>Nike Epic React Flyknit 2 Review Running Shoes Guru From runningshoesguru.com</center>
<p>The nike epic react is the first shoe to feature nike�s new react foam technology. Nike made a fantastic shoe by not making the phantom run 2 overly soft. The first odyssey react was an above average shoe with some issues that made it an average shoe for me. The nike epic react 2 comes on the heels of the wildly popular first version, a simple shoe that is just as wearable with a pair of jeans or joggers around town as it is on the race course.our regular believers don’t need a reminder that the epic react was one of our favorite shoes of 2018;</p>

<p>Quite a bummer that i can’t use them as a casual shoe (i loved the epic react for this), but at the end of the day, it is a running shoe, and it works well in that capacity (as it should). They are made for real runners. The ride is responsive, yet soft, and never sloppy. I ran twice 20k in them my legs and feet felt good. For the nike epic react review, i had 24 miles on them in the first two runs, but i like them so much that i picked them to run in over and over the last week and a half. That is very important because when a running shoe has such a high portion of cushioning (by 24 % more than nike epic react flyknit 2 and 30 mm in total) and it is tall, it needs to be wide.</p>
