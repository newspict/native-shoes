<p>I need some shoes that are good for weightlifting (squats and deadlifts) but also versatile enough to wear with shorts and chinos. The deadlift is one of the best compound exercises that can be done for building overall strength, and choosing the right shoe can be the difference between a good training session and a bad one. A weightlifting shoe’s construction can sometimes take away from our deadlift performance, and here’s why. Wearing a shoe that feels comfortable, stable and allows you to get in a good position for deadlifting can make a real difference. You may see people at the gym deadifting in weightlifting shoes that have raised heels, but that doesnt mean it’s the right thing to do. The goal of performing deadlifts is to pick up weight from the ground by utilizing mechanics to put us into the best and strongest positions possible.</p>
