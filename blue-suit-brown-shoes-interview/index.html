<p>17 Fall Men Interview Outfits That Are Easy To Recreate, But someone was telling me that it�s best to wear black shoes and only black shoes for finance interviews. Be it to an interview, a friend’s wedding, or a corporate meeting, you have to look your best. Navy blue suit, blue or white shirt, simple tie. Brown shoes are a must with suits like this (from l to r) charcoal.</p>

<p>Orange tie x Blue suit Blue suit brown shoes, Light blue, I am thinking of wearing my navy blue tommy hilfiger slim fit suit that i bought last year. I just think brown is a casual looking color that in some ways the phrase brown dress shoe is almost an oxymoron for me the same as short sleeve dress shirt. But someone was telling me that it�s best to wear black.</p>

<p>What to Wear to an Interview Interview Attire for Men, This probably seems really petty, but i feel that theres a fine line between looking sharp and looking. When it comes to blue suit and shoes combinations, i think that a pair of brown shoes is the best colour to go for when pairing with a blue suit. If your profession centers itself around design and creativity, you shouldn’t pass.</p>

<p>13 Midnight Blue Suit &amp; Brown Shoes StyleMann, I am getting the vibe that the red oxblood loafers are the more fashionable of the pairs but i feel like black is the norm for interviews. While this may work for a formal occasion, if you’re looking out for a more casual appeal, try jeans or other trousers for lowers. It’s often believed that black suits are good for.</p>
