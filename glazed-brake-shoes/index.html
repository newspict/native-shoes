<p>The brakes have been heated up to the point that they become hardened and are no longer create enough friction on the brake drum or rotor. Glazed brake pads can negatively affect your car�s braking efficiency by increasing its braking distance. If any glaze remains continue sanding and spraying with brake kleen until you are satisfied. Glazing results in excessive stopping distances, and it can happen without the driver’s knowledge.</p>

<p>Glazing happens when temperatures exceed the brake pad limits. I made sure they all were way behind me or in front of me on the road after that. I�m showing you how i fixed my glazed brake problem. My rear shoes have a slight glaze to them and they are only two months old. Shoe linings that are contaminated (or brake drums that are glazed) can cause the sensation of a hard or grabby brake pedal. The top problem associated with bad brake shoes is noise.</p>

<p>Brakes pads keep glazing how to prevent it?? MY350Z, First i wash them and then use brake clean to get the glaze completely off.

<p>VERA FILES AT 10 Faulty brakes or human error Tanay bus, I swear every month i end up pulling both off and sanding them and the drum and bell.
