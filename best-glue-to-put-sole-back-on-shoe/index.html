<p>Sole Protectors Pros, Cons, and How to Glue Your Own, Flexible is preferable to something which sets hard. We heard that professional resolers used it. What type of adhesive would a shoe repairer use to fix this? One has to clean the area well, apply the cement to both surfaces, wait for the recommended time, then clamp.
